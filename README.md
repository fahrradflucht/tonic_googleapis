# tonic_googleapis

This repository contains generated gRPC clients for Google APIs. All client
libraries are generated using [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic).

## Supported Services

In order to not spam crates.io with more unused and potentially broken,
generated googleapi client libraries, I only add what I actually use. If you
need a particular service feel free to open a PR or an issue.

- [google.datastore.v1](https://crates.io/crates/tonic_datastore_v1)
